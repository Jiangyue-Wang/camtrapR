<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h2>
<p>Multi-species occupancy models are a powerful group of models that
combine information from many species to estimate individual species’
responses as well as community-level responses to environmental
variables.</p>
<p>They are normally fit in Bayesian frameworks, e.g. BUGS, JAGS or
Nimble. Creating the necessary input for these models from camera
trapping data, writing the model code, setting parameters to monitor,
initial values etc. can however be daunting, and even for seasoned users
can be a tedious and time-consuming task.</p>
<p>A new extension of camtrapR aims to simplify this process by
automatically and flexibly creating custom community occupancy models
that are ready for analysis in JAGS or Nimble. The workflow
supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous and categorical site covariates on detection and
occupancy probability</li>
<li>continuous and categorical observation-level covariates on detection
probability</li>
<li>fixed and random effects of all these covariates</li>
<li>independent effects of continuous site covariates between the
different species</li>
<li>nested random effects</li>
<li>fixed, independent or random intercepts of detection and occupancy
probability</li>
<li>data augmentation (fully open community or known maximum species
richness)</li>
<li>species richness estimates</li>
<li>models in JAGS and Nimble</li>
<li>derived quantities, e.g. Bayesian p-values (overall and by species)
and species richness estimates</li>
</ul>
<p>The main function is <code><a href="../reference/communityModel.html">communityModel()</a></code>. It automates:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing model code</li>
<li>setting parameters to monitor</li>
<li>setting initial values</li>
<li>bundling input data</li>
</ul>
<p>The output is a <code>commOccu</code> object. The workflow then
provides methods for:</p>
<ul>
<li>fitting models</li>
<li>plotting marginal effects (response curves)</li>
<li>plotting effect sizes</li>
<li>spatial predictions of species occupancy probabilities</li>
<li>spatial predictions of species richness</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of fit() is an mcmc.list from the coda package and can be
uses as such, so the summary(), plot(), etc. methods are available as
well as the functions from bayesplot.</p>
<p>The main function <code>communityModel</code> does not support R
formula syntax the way packages like unmarked or ubms do Instead,
covariates and their effect types are specified via a few dedicated
function arguments. This non-standard approach may change in the future
to instead support formula syntax. On the other hand it might be less
confusing than the lme4 syntax for random effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="warning">Warning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#warning"></a>
</h2>
<p>A word of caution, please always check the model code and make sure
you understand the code and agree with it. The workflow is meant to be
convenient and does not require you to even look at the model code, but
you should (there are many comments in the model code to make it
easier). This workflow still requires a proper understanding of Bayesian
modelling frameworks and the concepts behind multi-species occupancy
models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations"></a>
</h2>
<p>The workflow is still rather experimental, so please remain critical
of the results and check carefully. If you encounter any problems,
please let me know.</p>
<p>There are currently a few limitations in the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>priors can not be customized</li>
<li>models with categorical observation-level covariates cannot be
compiled in Nimble and must be fit in JAGS instead</li>
<li>nested random effects and random effects of site covariates are
still experimental, and the plot_* methods don’t work on these yet</li>
<li>likewise, the output of <code>predict</code> may not be correct for
these</li>
<li>input checks are a bit limited and may not always lead to meaningful
error messages. This will improve over time with user feedback.</li>
<li>Nimble does not yet seem to have an advantage in processing speed.
That might require further customization</li>
<li>independent effects are only supported in continuous site
covariates</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time these will likely be worked on.</p>

<p>For example, a fixed intercept of occupancy (constant across species)
is <em>beta0</em>, and a fixed intercept of detection probability is
<em>alpha0</em>.</p>
<p>An occupancy probability intercept with a random effect of species
is:</p>
<p><strong>beta0.mean</strong> community mean of the occupancy
probability intercept</p>
<p><strong>beta0.sigma</strong> standard deviation of the community
occupancy probability intercept.</p>
<p><strong>beta0[1]</strong> occupancy probability intercept of species
1 (likewise for other species).</p>
<p>For effects of site covariates, the pattern is:</p>
<p><em>submodel.effectType.covariateType.CovariateName.hyperparameter</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>beta.ranef.cont.habitat.mean</strong> is the mean community
effect of the continuous site covariate ‘habitat’ on occupancy
probability.</p>
<p><strong>beta.ranef.cont.habitat[1]</strong> is the effect of
continuous site covariate ‘habitat’ on occupancy probability of species
1.</p>
<p>Site-occasion covariates are denoted by <em>.obs</em> after the
submodel, e.g.:</p>
<p><strong>alpha.obs.fixed.cont.effort</strong> is the fixed effect of
the continuous observation-level covariate ‘effort’ on detection
probability</p>

</h2>
<p>Here is a quick example using the sample data that are included in
camtrapR. The data set only contains five species at three fictional
camera trap stations, and use made-up covariates (so the parameter
estimates will be nonsense, ecologically). It is only a technical
demonstration for how community models fit into the camtrapR
workflow.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-preparation">Data preparation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-preparation"></a>

<p>First load the camera trap table and create a camera operation
matrix:</p>

<p>Now <code>data_list</code> is a list containing the detection
histories, site covariates and occasion level covariates.</p>
<p>N.B.: It is always necessary to provide an effort matrix. This is to
ensure that detection probability is 0 when there was no effort. This is
achieved by creating a binary effort matrix based on the user-provided
effort matrix. The binary effort matrix is 0 for all cells where effort
= NA, and 1 for all cells with values (no matter what values). Thus, all
occasions with effort = NA in the povided above effort matrix will have
detection probability = 0.</p>
<p>Also note that this does <strong>not</strong> automatically include
effort as a covariate on detection probability. To include effort as a
covariate on detection probability, include “effort” in argument
<code>detCovsObservation</code> (you can specify a fixed or random
effect).</p>

<p>Now the interesting part. The function communityModel() creates a new
class, “commOccu”. It is an object that contains all relevant
information for running a community occupancy model. Here we will create
a JAGS model (the default). For a model in Nimble, see further

<p>This call defined a model with a fixed effect of utm_y on occupancy
probability of all species, and a species-specific (random) effect of
elevation on occupancy probability. Furthermore, we specified effort as
a covariate on detection probability (constant across species), and
there are random effects of species on the intercepts of detection and
occupancy probabilities.</p>

the model text. In real examples you’d probably want to use a persistent

<p>NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for
statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and
computationally-intensive methods. NIMBLE is built in R but compiles
your models and algorithms using C++ for speed.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://r-nimble.org/" class="external-link uri">https://r-nimble.org/</a>)</p>
<p>It allows you to run the same models as BUGS or JAGS, but can be much
faster in some situations.</p>
<p>Using Nimble for community occupancy models requires the packages
“nimble” and “nimbleEcology”:</p>

<p>Using nimble only makes sense if one can compile the models (which
runs them as fast C++ code). Compiling Nimble code requires Rtools.</p>
<p>You can obtain Rtools from: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/</a>.</p>
<p>It then needs to be put in PATH, see here for how to do it: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/#putting-rtools-on-the-path" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/#putting-rtools-on-the-path</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on where you installed Rtools, you should see something
like “C:/rtools40/usr/bin” somewhere in the output of the following line
(for me it’s usually the first or second entry).</p>

<p>The example above was very small and unrealistic. We can’t provide a
large camera trapping data set in camtrapR, but we can simulate one
using the <code>simComm</code> function from the <code>AHMbook</code>

estimates to the “true” parameters (which were used to create the
simulated data).</p>

we used simulated data we can compare model estimates with the
truth. For example, the true effect of habitat on occupancy was mean =
0.5 (SD = 0.5). See <code>beta.ranef.cont.habitat.mean</code> and
<code>beta.ranef.cont.habitat.sigma</code> in the table above for
estimates.</p>
<p>The mean effect of wind on detection probability was -0.5 (SD = 1).
See <code>alpha.obs.ranef.cont.wind.mean</code> and
<code>alpha.obs.ranef.cont.wind.sigma</code> in the table above for
estimates.</p>
<p>Bayesian p-values can be inspected to check for lack of fit (overall
or by species). Lack of fit at significance level = 0.05 is indicated by
Bayesian p-values below 0.025 or greater than 0.975. In the example
above, the overall Bayesian p-value (Bpvalue) indicates no problems with
lack of fit. Likewise, species-level Bayesian p-values (Bpvalue_species)
indicate no lack of fit for any species. This is not surprising because
the model uses simulated data.</p>

<p>The examples so far did not have any missing data in the detection
histories. Real-world data commonly have missing data though, e.g. due
to camera malfunction or specific study designs. In single-species
occupancy models (e.g. in unmarked or ubms) this is handled
automatically, but requires a little more attention in these
multi-species models (at least when fitting with Nimble). Let’s modify
the above data set and introduce some NAs in the detection history and
the effort matrix:</p>

<p>After converting NAs to 0, Nimble models can be run without warnings
and summaries can be calculated.</p>
<p>To prevent the additional 0s from affecting the estimation of
detection probabilities, information about occasions without effort is
provided via the mandatory argument <code>effortCov</code> in the
<code>communityModel</code> function. Use the <code>$effort</code> part
of the output of <code><a href="../reference/detectionHistory.html">detectionHistory()</a></code> to provide the
necessary information, and of course ensure that
<code>detectionHistory</code> is run with
<code>includeEffort = T</code>. All occasions with NA in the effort
matrix will have their detection probabilities fixed at 0. This ensures
that those occasions do not affect the model fit. Be aware that this
does not include effort as a covariate on detection. Including effort as
a covariate on detection would need to be done via
<code>detCovsObservation</code>.</p>

<p>Site covariates will be interpreted as categorical if they are
factors in the input data frame. If a random effect of a categorical
covariate is defined, there will be independent species-level random
effects within each factor level of the categorical covariate. In other
words, each factor level will have its own and independent random effect
of species.</p>

<p>In the table below, see the arguments
<code>beta.ranef.categ.categ</code>. The species effects have two
indices: [species, factorLevel]. Accordingly, there are three estimates
for <code>mean</code> and <code>SD</code>, respectively. All estimates
for the first factor level are 0, since the intercept refers to the
first factor level (i.e. reference level, which we defined as “medium”
above).</p>

<p>By default random effects are by species. Alternatively, you can
specify random effects of a categorical site covariate2 on continuous
covariate1 using the pattern:</p>
<p>occuCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>The same syntax can be used in</p>
<p>detCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>detCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>Here is an example, where the effect of “habitat” differs between
levels of “categ”.</p>

</h3>
<p>Species and site random effect on detection probability can be
helpful if Bayesian p-values indicate lack of fit (overall and / or for
individual species). Such an effect can be added via argument
<code>speciesSiteRandomEffect</code>. Setting it to TRUE adds a random
effect “ran” to detection probability in the form:</p>
<p>logit.p[i,j,k] &lt;- alpha0[i] + … + <strong>ran[i, j]</strong></p>
<p>where i,j are species and station and occasion indices.
<code>ran</code> is defined as:</p>
<p>ran[i,j] ~ dnorm(0, tau.ran)</p>
<p>with <code>tau.ran</code> being the precision of the normal
distribution (precision = 1 / standard deviation).</p>
<p>Site is defined as the sampling location (e.g. camera trap station in
this context).</p>

<p>The easiest way to include quadratic effects is by squaring the
covariate and including it as a new covariate. The plot_* and predict
methods will be able to identify the quadratic term via a required
keyword (the suffix “_squared” by default).</p>
<p>Covariates should be scaled to prior to squaring (“habitat” in this
examples is already scaled).</p>

<p>In these examples we did not return confidence intervals. Doing so
would be easy by setting <code>intervals =  "confidence"</code>.</p>
<p>Computation can take long on larger rasters and can require lots of
RAM. Check RAM usage during computations.</p>

<p>The <code>predict</code> function can be used to calculate Percentage
of Area Occupied (PAO) for all species, optionally for a given area of
interest (AOI).</p>
<p>For demonstration, let’s create a AOI as a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.
Normally you’d just load a shapefile or other spatial vector data
set.</p>

<p>Instead of a standard occupancy model one can fit the occupancy model
of Royle and Nichols (2003), which relates probability of detection of
the species to the number of individuals available for detection at each
site (instead of their occupancy status alone). Probability of occupancy
is a derived parameter: the probability that at least one individual is
available for detection at the site. It is achieve by setting the
parameter “model” to “RN”:</p>

<p>Incidentally, the workflow above can be used for single-species
models too. The code will be less streamlined and possibly slower than
normal code for single-species models (due to the species loop which is
unnecessary for single-species models), but it is possible. Simply pass
a single detection history in the data_list$ylist of the input to
<code>communityModel</code>.</p>
<p>Take care to only define fixed effects for covariates and the
intercepts, not random effects of species. It is possible however to
specify random effects of categorical site covariates on continuous site
covariates as in the example below.</p>
<p>In this example we use species 1 from the community created with
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/AHMbook/man/simComm.html" class="external-link">AHMbook::simComm</a></code>.</p>

functions currently don’t work for this case, since single-species
models are mostly a side-effect of the intended community occupancy
workflow and not the main goal. There are other great options for
Bayesian single-species occupancy models, e.g. in the packages ubms or
wiqid, or unmarked for a frequentist implementation.</p>
