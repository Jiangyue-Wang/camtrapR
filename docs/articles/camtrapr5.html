<h1 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h1>
<p>Multi-species occupancy models are a powerful group of models that combine information from many species to estimate individual species’ responses as well as community-level responses to environmental variables.</p>
<p>They are normally fit in Bayesian frameworks, e.g. BUGS, JAGS or Nimble. Creating the necessary input for these models from camera trapping data, writing the model code, setting parameters to monitor, initial values etc. can however be daunting, and even for seasoned users can be a tedious and time-consuming task.</p>
<p>A new extension of camtrapR aims to simplify this process by automatically and flexibly creating custom community occupancy models that are ready for analysis in JAGS or Nimble. The workflow supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>continuous and categorical site covariates on detection and occupancy probability</li>
<li>fixed and random effects of these covariates</li>
<li>continuous and categorical observation-level covariates on detection probability</li>
<li>fixed or random intercepts of detection and occupancy probability</li>
<li>nested random effects</li>
<li>random effects of categorical site covariates</li>
<li>data augmentation (fully open community or known maximum species richness)</li>
<li>species richness estimates</li>
<li>models in JAGS and Nimble</li>
<li>Bayesian p-values (overall and by species)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main function is <code><a href="../reference/communityModel.html">communityModel()</a></code>. It automates:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing model code</li>
<li>setting parameters to monitor</li>
<li>setting initial values</li>
<li>bundling input data</li>
</ul>
<p>The workflow provides methods for:</p>
<ul>
<li>fitting models</li>
<li>plottingmarginal effects (response curves)</li>
<li>plotting effect sizes</li>
<li>spatial predictions of species occupancy probabilities</li>
<li>spatial predictions of species richness</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of fit() is an mcmc.list from the coda package and can be uses as such, so the summary(), plot(), etc. methods are available as well as the functions from bayesplot.</p>
<p>The main function <code>communityModel</code> does not support R formula syntax the way packages like unmarked or ubms do Instead, covariates and their effect types are specified via a few dedicated function arguments. This non-standard approach may change in the future to instead support formula syntax. On the other hand it might be less confusing than the lme4 syntax for random effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="warning">Warning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#warning"></a>
</h1>
<p>A word of caution, please always check the model code and make sure you understand the code and agree with it. The workflow is meant to be convenient and does not require you to even look at the model code, but you should (there are many comments in the model code to make it easier). This workflow still requires a proper understanding of Bayesian modelling frameworks and the concepts behind multi-species occupancy models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="limitations">Limitations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#limitations"></a>
</h1>
<p>The workflow is still rather experimental, so please remain critical of the results and check carefully. If you encounter any problems, please let me know.</p>
<p>There are currently a few limitations in the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>priors can not be customized yet.</li>
<li>models with categorical observation-level covariates cannot be compiled in Nimble and must be fit in JAGS instead</li>
<li>nested random effects and random effects of site covariates are still experimental, and the plot_* methods don’t work on these yet</li>
<li>likewise, the output of <code>predict</code> may not be correct for these</li>
<li>input checks are a bit limited and may not always lead to meaningful error messages. This will improve over time with user feedback.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="parameter-naming-convention">Parameter naming convention<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameter-naming-convention"></a>
</h1>
<p>The parameter names are assembled from standardized building blocks. The nomenclature is as follows:</p>
<p>For example, a fixed intercept of occupancy (constant across species) is <em>beta0</em>, and a fixed intercept of detection probability is <em>alpha0</em>.</p>
<p>An occupancy probability intercept with a random effect of species is:</p>
<p><strong>beta0.mean</strong> community mean of the occupancy probability intercept</p>
<p><strong>beta0.sigma</strong> standard deviation of the community occupancy probability intercept.</p>
<p><strong>beta0[1]</strong> occupancy probability intercept of species 1 (likewise for other species).</p>
<p>For effects of site covariates, the pattern is:</p>
<p><em>submodel.effectType.covariateType.CovariateName.hyperparameter</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>beta.ranef.cont.habitat.mean</strong> is the mean community effect of the continuous site covariate ‘habitat’ on occupancy probability.</p>
<p><strong>beta.ranef.cont.habitat[1]</strong> is the effect of continuous site covariate ‘habitat’ on occupancy probability of species 1.</p>
<p>Site-occasion covariates are denoted by <em>.obs</em> after the submodel, e.g.:</p>
<p><strong>alpha.obs.fixed.cont.effort</strong> is the fixed effect of the continuous observation-level covariate ‘effort’ on detection probability</p>
</div>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="quick-example">Quick example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#quick-example"></a>
</h1>
<p>Here is a quick example using the sample data that are included in camtrapR. The data set only contains five species at three fictional camera trap stations, and use made-up covariates (so the parameter estimates will be nonsense, ecologically). It is only a technical demonstration for how community models fit into the camtrapR workflow.</p>

<p>First load the camera trap table and create a camera operation matrix:</p>

<p>Now we load the record table and create a list of detection histories. Here we include all species, but you may want to subset the record table first.

<p>Now <code>data_list</code> is a list containing the detection histories, site covariates and occasion level covariates.</p>
<p>N.B.: It is always necessary to provide an effort matrix. This is to ensure that detection probability is 0 when there was no effort. This is achieved by creating a binary effort matrix based on the user-provided effort matrix. The binary effort matrix is 0 for all cells where effort = NA, and 1 for all cells with values (no matter what values). Thus, all occasions with effort = NA in the povided above effort matrix will have detection probability = 0.</p>
<p>Also note that this does <strong>not</strong> automatically include effort as a covariate on detection probability. To include effort as a covariate on detection probability, include “effort” in argument <code>detCovsObservation</code> (you can specify a fixed or random effect).</p>

<p>This call defined a model with a fixed effect of utm_y on occupancy probability of all species, and a species-specific (random) effect of elevation on occupancy probability. Furthermore, we specified effort as a covariate on detection probability (constant across species), and there are random effects of species on the intercepts of detection and occupancy probabilities.</p>

<p>NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods. NIMBLE is built in R but compiles your models and algorithms using C++ for speed.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://r-nimble.org/" class="external-link uri">https://r-nimble.org/</a>)</p>
<p>It allows you to run the same models as BUGS or JAGS, but can be much faster in some situations.</p>
<p>Using Nimble for community occupancy models requires the packages “nimble” and “nimbleEcology”:</p>

<p>Using nimble only makes sense if one can compile the models (which runs them as fast C++ code). Compiling Nimble code requires Rtools.</p>
<p>You can obtain Rtools from: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/</a>.</p>
<p>It then needs to be put in PATH, see here for how to do it: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/#putting-rtools-on-the-path" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/#putting-rtools-on-the-path</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on where you installed Rtools, you should see something like “C:/rtools40/usr/bin” somewhere in the output of the following line (for me it’s usually the first or second entry).</p>

<p>One can define fixed effects of covariates if the responses are thought to be constant across all species. This might make sense for the effect of sampling effort in camera trapping studies.</p>

<p>It is not yet possible to customize priors. The current defaults are:</p>

<li>dnorm(0, 0.05) : random effect means</li>
<li>dgamma(0.1, 0.1): random effect precision (tau)</li>

<p>We know there are 20 species in the simulated community example. We can inform the model that the community is known to consist of 20 species via: <code>augmentation = c(maxknown = 20)</code>:</p>

<p>Site covariates will be interpreted as categorical if they are factors in the input data frame. If a random effect of a categorical covariate is defined, there will be independent species-level random effects within each factor level of the categorical covariate. In other words, each factor level will have its own and independent random effect of species.</p>
<p>Here is an example with a categorical site covariate “categ” on occupancy:</p>

<p>In the table below, see the arguments <code>beta.ranef.categ.categ</code>. The species effects have two indices: [species, factorLevel]. Accordingly, there are three estimates for <code>mean</code> and <code>SD</code>, respectively. All estimates for the first factor level are 0, since the intercept refers to the first factor level (i.e. reference level, which we defined as “medium” above).</p>

<p>By default random effects are by species. Alternatively, you can specify random effects of a categorical site covariate2 on continuous covariate1 using the pattern:</p>
<p>occuCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>The same syntax can be used in</p>
<p>detCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>detCovs(ranef = c(“covariate1|covariate2”))</p>
<p>Here is an example, where the effect of “habitat” differs between levels of “categ”.</p>

<p>The easiest way to include quadratic effects is by squaring the covariate and including it as a new covariate. The plot_* and predict methods will be able to identify the quadratic term via a required keyword (the suffix “_squared” by default).</p>
<p>Covariates should be scaled to prior to squaring (“habitat” in this examples is already scaled).</p>

<p>Incidentally, the workflow above can be used for single-species models too. The code will be less streamlined and possibly slower than normal code for single-species models (due to the species loop which is unnecessary for single-species models), but it is possible. Simply pass a single detection history in the data_list$ylist of the input to <code>communityModel</code>.</p>
<p>Take care to only define fixed effects for covariates and the intercepts, not random effects of species. It is possible however to specify random effects of categorical site covariates on continuous site covariates as in the example below.</p>
<p>In this example we use species 1 from the community created with simComm.</p>
